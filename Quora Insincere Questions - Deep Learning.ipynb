In the first notebook, I built a very quick baseline model using TFIDF- Logistic Reg and Linear SVC. I did not do much pre-processing apart from removing punctuation and I used uni-grama and bigrams.\n\nThis time, I will try something more complex, and LSTM based model that uses pre-trained GloVe Word Embeddings. Having had a glance at the kaggle kernels, a relatively simple deep learning model should aim for 0.67+ leaderboard score, while I should be able to tune and increase complexity up to the winners scores at ~0.71."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
